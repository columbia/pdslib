# On-device budgeting

## Tasks

- [] What can we learn from https://private-attribution.github.io/api/? Terminology, API design, structure. Any implementation? Also see slides: https://github.com/patcg/meetings/blob/main/2024/09/27-tpac/Privacy-Preserving%20Attribution%20Proposed%20Roadmap.pdf. But keep in mind that we want to support use cases beyond advertising.
- [] Generate Kotlin bindings with UniFFI to check that the Rust `pdslib` crate will be usable in Android. See https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/latest/tutorial/foreign_language_bindings.html
- [] Check whether we can reuse the OpenDP accountant if we want to use RDP/zCDP, without having to execute a measurement on real data. Check out the `compose` function here: https://docs.rs/opendp/latest/opendp/measures/struct.ZeroConcentratedDivergence.html, check if they offer filters directly.

## Getting started

- Install Cargo for Rust package management, and `uv` (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package management.
- Create a new virtual environment by running  `uv sync` at the root of this repository. This will also install some useful binaries like  `just` or `maturin`.
- Activate the venv with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
- Run commands like `python hello.py`.
- To compile the Rust crate and install the Python package with autogenerated Rust bindings, run `just install`.

## Contributing

- Feel free to add useful shell commands to the `justfile`.
