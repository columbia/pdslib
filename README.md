# On-device budgeting

## Getting started

- Install Cargo for Rust package management, and `uv` (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package management.
- Create a new virtual environment by running  `uv sync` at the root of this repository. This will also install some useful binaries like  `just` or `maturin`.
- Activate the venv with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
- Run commands like `python hello.py`.
- To compile the Rust crate and install the Python package with autogenerated Rust bindings, run `just install`.

## Contributing

- Feel free to add useful shell commands to the `justfile`.
